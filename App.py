**What is Market Basket Analysis?:**

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique that is mostly used in the Retail Industry to uncover customer purchasing patterns and product relationships. The techniques used in MBA identify the patterns, associations, and relationships (revealing product groupings and which products are likely to be purchased together) in in frequently purchased items by customers in large transaction datasets collected/registered at the point of sale. The results of the Market Basket Analysis can be used by retailers or marketers to design and develop marketing and operation strategies for a retail business or organization.<br>
Market basket analysis mainly utilize Association Rules {IF} -> {THEN}. However, MBA assigns Business outcomes and scenarios to the rules, for example,{IF X is bought} -> {THEN Y is also bought}, so X,Y could be sold together. <br>

Definition: **Association Rule**

Let $I$= \{$i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{n}$\} be an itemset.

Let $D$= \{$t_{1},t_{2},\ldots ,t_{m}$\} be a database of transactions $t$. Where each transaction $t$ is a nonempty itemset such that ${t \subseteq I}$

Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I.

A rule is defined as an implication of the form:
$X\Rightarrow Y$, where ${X,Y\subseteq I}$.

The rule ${X \Rightarrow Y}$ holds in the dataset of transactions $D$ with support $s$, where $s$ is the percentage of transactions in $D$ that contain ${X \cup Y}$ (that is the union of set $X$ and set $Y$, or, both $X$ and $Y$). This is taken as the probability, ${P(X \cup Y)}$. Rule ${X \Rightarrow Y}$ has confidence $c$ in the transaction set $D$, where $c$ is the percentage of transactions in $D$ containing $X$ that also contains $Y$. This is taken to be the conditional probability, like ${P(Y | X)}$. That is,

* support ${(X \Rightarrow Y)}$ = ${P(X \cup Y)}$

* confidence ${(X \Rightarrow Y)}$ = ${P(X|Y)}$

The lift of the rule ${(X \Rightarrow Y)}$  is the confidence of the rule divided by the expected confidence, assuming that the itemsets $X$ and $Y$ are independent of each other.The expected confidence is the confidence divided by the frequency of ${Y}$.

* lift ${(X \Rightarrow Y)}$ = ${ \frac {\mathrm {supp} (X\cap Y)}{\mathrm {supp} (X)\times \mathrm {supp} (Y)}}$


Lift value near 1 indicates ${X}$ and ${Y}$ almost often appear together as expected, greater than 1 means they appear together more than expected and less than 1 means they appear less than expected.Greater lift values indicate stronger association

We are going to use the Apriori Algorithm for the association rule mining/analysis. Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational dataset. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the dataset and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the dataset. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends, pattern, and relationships in the dataset.

**RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) Analysis**

The “RFM” in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future.

1. How recently a customer has transacted with a brand
2. How frequently they’ve engaged with a brand
3. How much money they’ve spent on a brand’s products and services

RFM analysis enables marketers to increase revenue by targeting specific groups of existing customers (i.e., customer segmentation) with messages and offers that are more likely to be relevant based on data about a particular set of behaviors.
